                 Hello, my name is Sarah Randall. I currently live in Davis County, Utah with my husband and two little kids. I graduated from Utah State University 
                 with a bachelor's degree in Marketing in 2014. After that, I worked at the Huntsman Cancer Hospital and loved it there. Helping people made me feel 
                 fulfilled in my job. I also got my nail technician license for a creative outlet. My husband got a sales job offer that lead us to Cody, WY and St. George, UT. 
                 We are finally back up to Davis County and are happy to be back around family. I have been grateful to be a stay-at-home mom the past several years. 
                 Now that my kids are older, I am entering a new chapter in my life. I am ready to get back to work! I have always been able to get carried away with coding, especially 
                 the creation part. As a mom, I have become really good at Googling problems and love when I find a solution that works well. This has already helped me significantly as I am attending the 
                 University of Utah Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp. For me, finding solutions to coding issues has become very satisfying. I am also an organized person and feel that order brings 
                 clarity and efficiency. Learning that helping people, solving problems, creating, and organizing applies to coding has reassured me that coding will be the right fit for my career.
